Video 1. This video shows a demonstration of our program. Human voice inquiries are answered by our system. This version uses CdQA (Closed Domain Question and Answering, https://github.com/cdqa-suite/cdQA). At the same time, the system recognizes objects through the video camera, which is performed by Yolov5.

Video 2. This movie shows the movements of a 3D avatar. According to voice inquiry, the system gives an answer that is generated by CdQA. Based on the answer, the MakeItTalk module creates a movie that shows human-like 3D avatar movements..

Video 3. 3D photorealistic human faces created by a StyleGAN-like network We create these using the site Artbreeder (https://www.artbreeder.com). MyHeritage (https://www.myheritage.jp/) is used to generate the face movements. Animations with voice are created using MakeItTalk source code.

Video 4. The multiple tasks are completed by using two computers. The computer at right captures an external scene. This computer processes Yolov5 object detection. The image is transferred to the left PC. The left PC performs the Image2text routine, which gives sentences that explain the video image.

Video 6. An example of running a program to guess gender and age. Fortunately, the age is estimated to be very young. By increasing the resolution and adding information such as the degree of aging of the skin, it may be possible to estimate the age more accurately.
